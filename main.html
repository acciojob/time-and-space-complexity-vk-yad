    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm. It quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. The goal is to design algorithms with efficient time complexity to ensure fast execution, especially for large inputs.

        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm or program to complete its execution. It is typically expressed using Big O notation (O(n)), where 'n' represents the input size. Space complexity analysis helps in understanding how efficiently an algorithm utilizes memory resources, and optimizing it can lead to more memory-efficient programs.
